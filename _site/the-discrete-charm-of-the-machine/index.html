<div class="blog-content"><h3 id="introduction">Introduction</h3>

<p>In the early 19<sup>th</sup> century, foundational discoveries in the field of 
mathematics, physics, chemistry, and, oddly enough, embroidery paved 
the way to developing the lightning-quick computers we rely on today. 
Steiglitz explores the course of impact of these discoveries to inform 
the reader on how he believes technology will advance in the future.<br /><br /></p>

<h3 id="more-history-than-science">More History Than Science</h3>

<p>Steiglitz’s most exciting literary choice, as prefaced by his quip 
in the introduction, was to leave (most) equations out. The book is 
written for a general audience; Steiglitz includes clear explanations of 
scientific and mathematical material he reviews, although some 
material benefitted from background knowledge. Steiglitz has successfully 
written an approachable, in-depth narrative on analog and digital machines.
However, <em>The Discrete Charm of the Machine</em> still has much to offer to 
seasoned computer science veterans. Especially in the treasure trove of the 
footnotes, where he hides small tidbits, proofs, papers, and the 
occasional mention of the <em>Antikythera device</em> that veers off his train 
of thought. The resources he includes are a nice addition for those looking 
for more specialized readings on the book’s topics but are not essential to 
illustrate the big picture.</p>

<p>Narrative structure plays a significant role in how Steiglitz portrays 
his timeline. At the heart of <em>The Discrete Charm of the Machine</em> is 
Steiglitz’s definition of a modern computer, which is broken up into 
six general concepts revealed by the discoveries he writes about. 
Each chapter draws the reader closer to his definition until we get 
a clear understanding of the path history took to reach our level 
of machine sophistication. The book rarely abides to chronology and 
to great effect. Instead, Steiglitz chooses to highlight the advantages 
that digital machines had over analog ones, a concept which he discusses 
in great detail. He does this by alternating descriptions of analog
machines and their digital counterparts, focusing on what each machine
contributed towards his definition of a modern computer. Despite this, 
the reader is never left behind, unless they are willing to follow 
the footnotes in great detail. The brilliance of <em>The Discrete Charm 
of the Machine</em> is in its simplicity.<br /><br /></p>

<h3 id="final-thoughts">Final Thoughts</h3>

<p>Steiglitz excels in providing context to the quick advancement of digital 
machines. He expertly describes fundamental computing topics like ‘transistors’ 
and ‘NP-complete algorithms’, tying them together to form a basic understanding 
of new emerging fields in computer science. <em>The Discrete Charm of the Machine</em> 
is a must-read for computer science enthusiasts and casual readers
alike.<br /><br /></p>
